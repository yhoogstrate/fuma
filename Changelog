2016-04-05  Youri Hoogstrate
	
	* Version 3.0.1: Added a simple break statement ensures that the output is
	  in the order of the number of datasets in which a fusion gene is being
	  found.
	  
	  The logging function now does not skip the 100.0% which was caused in some
	  cases occured due to a rounding artefact.

2016-04-01  Youri Hoogstrate
	 
	* Version 3.0.0: The core has been rewritte because it needed to use much
	  less memory for a large number of datasets. Initially the code created
	  sub datasets, because it was expected to export them time-wise and it was
	  very handy for running unit tests and for creating the summary output.
	  This resulted in a very high memory consumption for a large number of
	  experiments (not with respect to the number of total Fusion genes).
	  The rewritten code consumes memory in relation to the total number of
	  Fusion objects. However, for the summary output we still use the legacy
	  code and for the list output we make use of the new code.
	  
	  FuMa now starts with a n*n (num Fusion objects in all experiments)
	  triangular matrix in which it compares all fusions with any other fusion
	  gene. If they are considered identical, a MergedFusion object will be
	  stored for the next iteration. Otherwise, at the end of the iteration,
	  all non matched fusion genes will be exported to file.
	  
	  For the remaining MergedFusion genes, FuMa will create a m (number of
	  MergedFusion objects) * n square matrix and compare whether the Fusion
	  genes matches the Merged fusion genes. Again, if they are identical,
	  they will be kept for the next iteration (these MergedFusion objects
	  will contain 3, 4 or more original Fusion objects each) and those that
	  are not being matched will be exported to file. For those that will be
	  kept for the next iteration, 'duplicates' will be removed. If no matched
	  objects remain, FuMa is finished.
	  
	  Because of this update, for analysis with a low number of samples and a
	  high number of fusion genes, FuMa may have become (quite) a bit slower. 
	  However, we believe the cost of some extra running time is much and much
	  more desired than the exponential memory requirements.
	  
	
		Important:
		We have also found and resolved a small bug. In older versions of FuMa,
		indexing was chromosome-name based. Therefore matching two fusion genes
		only happened when they were annotated upon the same chr name. If you
		would have a fusion gene A-B (both on chr1) and fusion A-B (both on
		chr2), the old versions would consider these distinct whereas the new
		version of FuMa considers these identical.
		
		Important 2:
		We have found another minor bug. In rare situations where no fusion
		gene was matched, the original fusion genes were not reported but
		such that the number of input files did not equal the number of
		output files (test_OverlapComplex 08_b and 09_05 and many in test 10).
		This bug has been resolved in v3.
